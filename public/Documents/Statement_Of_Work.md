# **Statement of Work**

**Project Title:** Launchpad Student Form  
 **Client:** Launchpad / Building 21  
 **Developer:** Antonio Archer  
 **Date:** May 19, 2025 – June 27, 2025

---

## **1\. Purpose**

This Statement of Work (SOW) will serve as a contract between Launchpad / Building 21 and Antonio Archer for the period of May 19 – June 27, 2025\. It outlines the details by which the work will be performed and measured for the development of the Launchpad Student Form.

---

## **2\. Background**

Launchpad’s Workforce Development program facilitates regular meetings between staff and students to support professional growth and educational engagement. Currently, the tracking and logging of these student interactions are manual and inefficient.

To improve data collection and internal reporting, this project proposes a web-based form system that will:

* Log student interactions

* Use AI (Playlab AI) to summarize logs

* Enable secure data storage

* Provide tools for optional email follow-ups

This will provide Launchpad staff a centralized, digital-first workflow to manage and analyze their ongoing engagement with students.

---

### **2.1 Problem Frame**

Launchpad / Building 21 requires a secure, AI-assisted internal tool to:

* Record interactions with students efficiently

* Summarize form submissions for faster reporting

* Email follow-ups if needed

* Maintain a timestamped record with relevant metadata

Failure to implement such a system may result in data inconsistencies, missed follow-ups, and a lack of actionable insight across student support programs.

## **3\. Scope**

| No. | Requirement | Details | Deliverables |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | Form Submission System | Staff can log meetings with students |  Interaction Form Interface |
| 2 | Data Fields | Timestamp, Student Name, Student ID, Interaction Type, Notes, Reason, Staff Response, UserID(user being staff) |  Structured Form Schema |
| 3 | AI Summary | Use Playlab AI to generate summaries of student interactions |  AI Integration, staff should be able to summarize their dashboard |
| 4 | Email Follow-Up | Trigger optional follow-up email to students |  Email Integration from app, to launchpad staff and students |
| 5 | Secure Storage | Secure database for storing logs | Encrypted Cloud Database |

## **5\. Stakeholders**

| Role | Name | Email | Phone |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Client PoC | Launchpad / Building 21 / Sanaa | TBD | TBD |
| Developer | Antonio Archer | TBD | TBD |
| Launchpad Staff Mentor | Rob T. / Nick I. | TBD | TBD |

## **6\. Pre-requisites**

The client will provide:

* Hosting infrastructure (DigitalOcean or similar)  
* Domain setup  
* Playlab AI API credentials  
* Any additional third-party services needed  
* Any additional information required to make the form such as student data, interaction types, and staff data

---

## **7\. Hosting and Support**

Upon successful completion and delivery of the project, Launchpad will provide **complimentary** hosting and maintenance on the project for **six months**. This complimentary service is estimated at a $1,000 value and includes:

* Hosting the site on a Launchpad-provided server  
* Providing and paying for all API access (rate-limited at 500 requests per day)  
* Server maintenance and troubleshooting

Note \- new features are **not** covered under this ongoing hosting and support, only fixing what the Launchpad associate has built if it breaks.

This project is pro bono. Any additional features outside scope must be negotiated separately.

---

## **8\. Success Criteria**

* All form fields are captured accurately and stored securely

* Staff can generate summaries using Playlab AI without errors

* Follow-up emails can be sent via interface

* Admin login works and is restricted to staff

* Client signs off on final product with 100% of scoped functionality

---

## **9\. Risks and Mitigation**

**Risk:** Playlab AI is a third-party dependency.  
 **Mitigation:** Any AI-related errors, outages, or performance issues are the responsibility of Playlab. The developer will provide fallback options but is not liable for external service behavior.

---

## **10\. Communication Plan**

Antonio Archer and Sanaa Igbokwe will meet weekly (or more frequently as needed) to review progress, provide feedback, and resolve blockers. Updates may also occur via email or instant messaging for flexibility.

---

## **11\. Legal**

Antonio Archer retains full copyright and authorship of all core source code and implementation logic developed during the project. However, Launchpad / Building 21 is granted a perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, modify, and build upon this code for internal purposes, including maintenance and future development.

All proprietary materials, including internal data, branding, and any summaries generated using Launchpad’s internal tools, remain the sole intellectual property of Launchpad / Building 21\. Reuse or redistribution of these proprietary elements by Antonio Archer without explicit written consent is strictly prohibited.

This agreement ensures that while Antonio Archer maintains the right to reuse general components and methodologies in future work, Launchpad / Building 21 retains full operational control and access to the codebase for their ongoing needs.
