---

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
# Clone the repo and enter the directory
git clone <your-repo-url> Launchpad_Student_Form
cd Launchpad_Student_Form
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Copy the example environment file and edit it with your credentials:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Gmail SMTP and DB settings
```

**Gmail SMTP setup:**
- Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail account
- Generate an "App Password" from Google Account settings
- Use the App Password as `EMAIL_PASSWORD` in `.env.local`

---

## üê≥ Running with Docker (Recommended)

### 1. Build and Start the App and Database
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
- App: http://localhost:3000
- DB:  localhost:5432 (user: postgres, password: postgres, db: launchpad)

### 2. Database Migrations (if needed)
```bash
docker compose exec app pnpm prisma migrate deploy
```

### 3. Stopping Containers
```bash
docker compose down
```

### 4. Reseeding the Database
```bash
docker compose run --rm seed
```

**Notes:**
- The `.env` file at the project root is used for all secrets/configuration (not copied into the image, but loaded at runtime).
- If you change `.env` or seed data, run:
  ```bash
  docker compose down -v
  docker compose up
  ```
- For troubleshooting, check logs:
  ```bash
  docker compose logs seed
  ```

## ‚è∞ Running Scheduled Follow-Ups with Docker Cron

If you want Docker to manage the daily follow-up email job, use the built-in cron service:

1. Make sure the `cron` service is enabled in `docker-compose.yml` (already set up).
2. The cron container will run the follow-up script every day at 7am (container time).
3. Logs are written to `/var/log/cron.log` inside the container.

### To view cron logs:
```bash
docker compose exec cron tail -n 50 /var/log/cron.log
```

### To test the script manually in the container:
```bash
docker compose exec cron node /app/scripts/send-scheduled-followups-docker.js
```

**Note:**
- The cron job uses the same environment variables as the app (from `.env`).
- You can still run the script on your host with your system's cron if you prefer.

## üìù Notes for Developers
- The app expects environment variables for DB and email config. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and edit as needed.
- For production, you can use the same Docker setup and provide production-ready environment variables.
- The Dockerfile uses Node 20 LTS and pnpm 9.x for best compatibility with the current codebase.
- If you need to customize the database, add more services, or have questions about deploying to cloud providers, reach out to the maintainer.
