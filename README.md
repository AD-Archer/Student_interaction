# Launchpad_Student_Form

A comprehensive student interaction tracking system with automated follow-up email scheduling for Launchpad Philly.

## üìß Follow-Up Email System

This application includes a complete automated follow-up email system that allows staff to schedule and send follow-up emails to both students and staff members.

### ‚ú® Features

- **Dual Recipient Selection**: Select both student and staff recipients with individual email inputs
- **Immediate & Scheduled Emails**: Send emails immediately for today/past dates, or schedule for future dates
- **Automated Scheduling**: Cron job automatically sends scheduled emails daily
- **Email Tracking**: Prevents duplicate emails by tracking sent status
- **Gmail SMTP Integration**: Professional email sending via Gmail SMTP
- **Development Mode**: Console logging when email credentials aren't configured

### üéØ How It Works

1. **Form Submission**: Staff selects recipients (student/staff) with checkboxes and enters email addresses
2. **Immediate Processing**: If follow-up date is today or past, emails are sent immediately
3. **Future Scheduling**: If follow-up date is in the future, emails are stored for scheduled sending
4. **Daily Cron Job**: Server runs daily cron job to send all scheduled emails for that day
5. **Status Tracking**: System marks emails as sent to prevent duplicates

### üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

#### 1. Database Migration
```bash
cd /Users/archer/projects/node/Launchpad_Student_Form
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
```

#### 2. Environment Configuration
Copy the example environment file and configure your Gmail SMTP settings:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your Gmail credentials:
```env
# Email Configuration for Gmail SMTP
EMAIL_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_PORT="587"
EMAIL_SECURE="false"
EMAIL_FROM="your-email@gmail.com"
EMAIL_PASSWORD="your-app-password"
```

**Important**: For Gmail, you need:
- 2-factor authentication enabled on your Gmail account
- An "App Password" (not your regular password) generated from Google Account settings
- Use the App Password as `EMAIL_PASSWORD`

#### 3. Production Deployment (DigitalOcean)

Set up the daily cron job on your server:
```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line to run daily at 7 AM
0 7 * * * /usr/bin/node /path/to/your/scripts/send-scheduled-followups.js
```

Alternatively, you can call the API endpoint from your server's cron:
```bash
# Daily at 7 AM via API call
0 7 * * * curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/followup-cron
```
